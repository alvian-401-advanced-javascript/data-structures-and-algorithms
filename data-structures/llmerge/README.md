#### [Data Structures](https://github.com/alvian-401-advanced-javascript/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/data-structures)  

#### DSA Implementation
   * Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored and a pointer to the next node.
   * adds `includes()` method that checks if a `value` is included in a list and returns a boolean
   * adds `insert()` method that can add a new node with given data  
   
   
#### ll-insertions
  * adds `append()` method that takes in a value and adds it to the end of the list  
  * adds `insertBefore()` method that inserts a new value before an existing value in a list
  * adds `insertAfter()` method that inserts a new value after an existing value in a list

  

#### ll_kth_from_end
   * adds method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list.


#### ll-merge
   * adds function called `mergeLists()` which takes two linked lists as arguments, zips the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list
   

#### Running the app
* node
