## Sorts: Implement Merge Sort
[PR]()

[![Build Status]()

# Insertion Sort

## Challenge
* Write a function for merge sort that takes in an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using insertion sort.

## Approach & Efficiency
* Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. So Merge Sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.

1) If it is only one element in the list it is already sorted, return. 
2) Divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided. 
3) Merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.
